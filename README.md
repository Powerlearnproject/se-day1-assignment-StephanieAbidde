Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a disciplone focused on the systematic development, design and maintenace of software to meet user needs

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.the developement of programming language
2. the establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
3. the rise of agile methodologies on the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - what the software is needed for or problems it seeks to solve
2. 2. Design - the software architecture or interface
   3. Implementation - Writing code and building software according to design specs.
   4. Testing - Running the code to ensure there are no defects.
   5. Deployment - making the aoftware available to the users
   6. maintenance - updating the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE - Software suites that provide comprehnesive tools for writin, debugging and testing code e.g Visual studio, eclipse.
VCS - tracks changes to source code and coordinate work among team members e.g GIT, subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements
Tight Deadlines
Technical depth
Solutions
Proper communication, routine testing, prioritization of task.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing - test individual modules or components of software
2. 2. Integration Testing - tests interations between different components.
   3. System testing - teststhe entire system as a whole.
   4. Acceptance testing - test the software against the users requirements to meet these requirements.
   They are important as these measures the effectiveness of the software in meeting users needs and overall development of the software.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a process of asking concise clear questions to the ai to get desired feedback or result. It is important to use prompts because they tell the ai exactly what the user needs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1. ai engineering definition
2. As an experienced software engineering professor, what is ai engineering?
